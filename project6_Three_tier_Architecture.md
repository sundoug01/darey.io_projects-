# Step 1 â€” Prepare a Web Server

- Launch an EC2 instance that will serve as "Web Server".

- Create 3 volumes in the same AZ as your Web Server EC2, each of 10 GiB

- Attach all three volumes one by one to your Web Server EC2 instance

> Use ``` lsblk ``` command to inspect what block devices are attached to the server, list  the /dev/ directory to confirm the attached volumes  and use the ```df -h ```
>  to see all mounts and free space on the web-server

- Use ``` gdisk ``` utility to create a single partition on each of the 3 disks
  
```
sudo gdisk /dev/xvdf  sudo gdisk /dev/xvdg  sudo gdisk /dev/xvdh
```

- Use ``` lsblk ``` utility to view the newly configured partition on each of the 3 disks.

- Install lvm2 package using ``` sudo yum install lvm2 ``` . Run  ``` sudo lvmdiskscan ``` command to check for available partitions.

> Had to register the vm and also ensure the vm has internet connection by editing the outbound rules

- Use pvcreate utility to mark each of 3 disks as physical volumes (PVs) to be used by LVM
```
sudo pvcreate /dev/xvdf1
sudo pvcreate /dev/xvdg1
sudo pvcreate /dev/xvdh1

```
- Verify that your Physical volume has been created successfully by running ``` sudo pvs ```

- Use vgcreate utility to add all 3 PVs to a volume group (VG). Name the VG webdata-vg
```
sudo vgcreate webdata-vg /dev/xvdh1 /dev/xvdg1 /dev/xvdf1
```
- Verify that your VG has been created successfully by running ``` sudo vgs ```

- Use ``` lvcreate ``` utility to create 2 logical volumes. apps-lv (Use half of the PV size), and logs-lv Use the remaining space of the PV size.
> NOTE: apps-lv will be used to store data for the Website while, logs-lv will be used to store data for logs.
```
sudo lvcreate -n apps-lv -L 14G webdata-vg
```
```
sudo lvcreate -n logs-lv -L 14G webdata-vg
```
- Verify that your Logical Volume has been created successfully by running ``` sudo lvs ```

- Verify the entire setup
```
sudo vgdisplay -v

```
#view complete setup - VG, PV, and LV
```
sudo lsblk
```

- Use mkfs.ext4 to format the logical volumes with ext4 filesystem
```
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/webdata-vg/apps-lv
```
```
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/webdata-vg/logs-lv
```
- Create /var/www/html directory to store website files
```
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html
```
- Create /home/recovery/logs to store backup of log data
```
sudo mkdir -p /home/recovery/logs
```
- Mount /var/www/html on apps-lv logical volume
```
sudo mount /dev/webdata-vg/apps-lv /var/www/html/
```
- Use rsync utility to backup all the files in the log directory /var/log into /home/recovery/logs (This is required before mounting the file system)
```
sudo rsync -av /var/log/. /home/recovery/logs/
```
- Mount /var/log on logs-lv logical volume. (Note that all the existing data on /var/log will be deleted. That is why step 15 above is very
important)
```
sudo mount /dev/webdata-vg/logs-lv /var/log
```
- Restore log files back into /var/log directory
```
sudo rsync -av /home/recovery/logs/. /var/log
```
