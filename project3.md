#### implementing a web solution based on the MERN stack in AWS Cloud [To deploy a simple To-Do application that creates To-Do lists]

> ### MERN Web stack consists of following components:
* MongoDB: A document-based, No-SQL database used to store application data in a form of documents.
* ExpressJS: A server side Web Application framework for Node.js.
* ReactJS: A frontend framework developed by Facebook. It is based on JavaScript, used to build User Interface (UI) components.
* Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser.

### Step 1

Update and upgrade Ubuntu

```
   sudo apt update
```
```
   sudo apt upgrade
```
Lets get the location of Node.js software from Ubuntu repositories.

- curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -

- Install Node.js with the command below

> sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

Verify the nodejs and npm version installation with the command below
```
 node -v 
 npm -v
```

- Application Code Setup

* Create a new directory for your To-Do project:
```
 mkdir Todo
```
Now change your current directory to the newly created one:
```
 cd Todo
```
Next, you will use the command *npm init* to initialise your project, so that a new file named *package.json* will be created.
This file will normally contain information about your application and the dependencies that it needs to run

### Step 2
- Expressjs installation 


To use express, install it using npm:
```
npm install express
```
Now create a file index.js with the command below
```
touch index.js
```
Run ls to confirm that your index.js file is successfully created

Install the dotenv module
```
npm install dotenv
```
Open the index.js file with the command below
```
vim index.js
```
Type the code below into it and save. Do not get overwhelmed by the code you see. For now, simply paste the code into the file.

```
  const express = require('express');
  require('dotenv').config();

  const app = express();

  const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;

  app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "\*");
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");
  next();
  });

  app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.send('Welcome to Express');
  });

  app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`)
 });
 
```
If all is good, running the command below  should output:
```
 node index.js
```

 Open port 5000 in EC2 security groups to access via browser. Open up your browser and try to access your serverâ€™s 
 Public IP or Public DNS name followed by port 5000:
 
```
  http://<PublicIP-or-PublicDNS>:5000
  ```
